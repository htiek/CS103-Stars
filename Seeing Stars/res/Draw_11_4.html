      In the space to the right, draw the star <b>{ 11 / 4 }</b>. We've drawn out 11 points for you. You just

      Remember that the number 4 here means "move four steps clockwise when drawing lines," rather than "skip
      four points when drawing lines." When you draw the first line, there should be three points skipped over
      between the endpoints of your line.
