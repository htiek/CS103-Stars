      Congratulations! You're done!
    </p>
    <p>
      You now know how to draw 7-pointed, 8-pointed, 10-pointed, and 12-pointed stars. And you have a general
      algorithm for find other sorts of stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there's still some mysteries left to resolve. What are the rules governing <i>p</i> and <i>s</i> that
      would make { <i>p</i> / <i>s</i> } a simple star? How many simple stars are there? These are mysteries that
      you'll get to explore over then next couple of weeks.

      Hope you had fun, and welcome to CS103!
