      You might have noticed that there's a general pattern you can follow to construct a star. It goes like this:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Pick a number of points. Let's call that number <b><i>p</i></b>.</li>
      <li>Pick a <i>step size</i>. Let's call that number <b><i>s</i></b>.</li>
      <li>Draw <i>p</i> evenly-spaced points around the perimeter of a circle.</li>
      <li>Choose a point on the circle as your starting point, then draw a line to the point <i>s</i> points
          down the circle, moving clockwise.</li>
      <li>Repeat the previous step until you end up back where you started.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The star that you get by drawing things this way is called the <b>{ <i>s</i> / <i>p</i> }</b> star.
      For example, the two stars that you drew in the previous sections were the <b>{ 7 / 2 }</b> star and
      the <b>{ 7 / 3 }</b> star.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over to the right you can see how this algorithm can be used to draw a bunch of different stars.
      By default it's showing the { 7 / 2 } star, but you can also choose to see some other ones:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="{ 7 / 2 }">See the { 7 / 2 } star.</a></li>
      <li><a href="{ 7 / 3 }">See the { 7 / 3 } star.</a></li>
      <li><a href="{ 9 / 2 }">See the { 9 / 2 } star.</a></li>
      <li><a href="{ 14 / 5 }">See the { 14 / 5 } star.</a></li>
      <li><a href="{ 19 / 6 }">See the { 19 / 6 } star.</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
